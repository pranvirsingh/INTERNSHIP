## Installing LAMP in Arch Linux

### Steps for the installation of LAMP are :-
- Installing Apache-web-server
    * Installing the Apache-web-server by using this command. ```sudo pacman -S apache``` in the terminal.
Install PHP dynamic server-side scripting language and its Apache module. 
    * ```sudo pacman -S php php-apache```
On the last step install MySQL database, choose 1 (MariaDB) community database fork then start and check daemon status.
    * ```sudo pacman -S mysql```
Now **LAMP** is installed in my system.

### Steps to secure MySql database

- The next step is to secure MySQL database by setting a password for root account, remove anonymous users accounts, remove test database and disallow remote login for user root.
    * ```sudo mysql_secure_installation```
Verify MySQL database connectivity by running the following command then leave database shell with quit or exit statement.
    * ```mysql -u root -p```

- Then I install php using this command.
    * ```sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql```

- Create a DocType which is analogous to a Model in other frameworks. Apart from defining properties, it also defines the behavior of the Model. And before creating DocTypes, we have to enter developer mode by using this command ```bench set-config -g developer_mode true``` and then start our bench server.

- Create second DocType called **Library Member**. It will have the following fields:
   * First Name (Data, Mandatory)
   * Last Name (Data)

# Daily-Work (15-9-22)

- Create a company at gne2 and set its domain to service. We will test over gne2.But We have a maintenance module.Here we can make others doctype related to maintenance.So, the Company Name : Construction & Maintenance Cell, Parent Company : NSET, Domain Name : Services

# Daily-Work (16-9-22)

- Create a dashboard for the maintenance request.
In which cmc user see the requests by date wise and see no. of requests per day.

# Daily-Work (17-9-22)

- In the web form, "justification for request"  field needs to be optional, not mandatory. And it needs to be "draft" upto the level of HoD, which means that HoD/OIc/Caretaker/Warden will be able to change it. No change will took place once the higher authority forwarded the request.

# Daily-Work (18-9-22)

- Today, I am working on Dashboard. Start learning about the Dashboard and make test dashboard.Becauses ,I have to make a Dadboard of all Higher Authorities like SDO,CMC -Head, HOd's of all Departments.

# Daily-Work (19-9-22)

- Today we are working on the workflow of CMC project. We made the flowchart of CMC Project.
- steps: student | employee -> HoD -> SDO -> O/Ic Incharge 
- But there migh be Student -> Caretaker -> Warden -> SDO or Lab Attendant | Lab Technician -> Lab Incharge -> HoD ... In case of rejected, all must see the status, and in case of any additional query it may be sent back from where is was forwarded.

# Daily-Work (20-9-22)

erp.gndec.ac.in and also creating a dashboard of SDE which is only
visible to SDE only.

# Daily-Work (4-10-22)

- Now our task is to create a button in the CMC request form for SDE
only in which SDE will manage the realtime stock items.

# Daily-Work (5-10-22)

- We have two options:
First:
We can add a custom button in the cmc request form using the form
script. The link which is following is:
https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/api/form
Â But here we have an issue of permissions. Because Custom button is
not a field in a doctype and in my knowledge we are only able to gives
permissions to doctype fields to show that fields to some specific
users so here we goes to our Second option

Second:
We can create a field which is of type "Button". I know this is a
silly question but how can we add links behind the Button type fields
in frappe??
I searched this on Google and found that we need to write custom
scripts to make this button working. But I didn't get the correct
syntax for this.

# Daily- Work (6-10-22)

- we checked that if we select items for estimate then it will also reduces in stock.So when our stock becomes completely empty then we need to send
quotations for required items. So now our next task is to send quotations and restore our stock again.

button, SDE will be able to handle quotations(estimate), sales order,
sales invoice(Bill).

# Daily- Work (2-11-22)

sales order of that quotations, in which we add our items which we

Today my task was to complete the requirements of CMC Project.The requirements  that we have to fullfile are:

1) If sales invoice value exceeds estimated cost then give alert message.

2) if sales invoice value exceeds Sanctioned cost then shouldn't
generate the bill.

- Inorder to complete we think that these requirements may be completed by the
  Notification feature in frappe. Me and pranvir just check it and we
  see that we can apply the condition in the "Condition" field. But this does not work for us.
-  Then we find one more solution that, there is a feature in client script called frappe.msgprint(). This function can be used with some conditions, so we can apply our conditions here.
-  Firstly we follow this link https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/client-script-to-fetch-value-from-another-doctype/1095/3 tutorial, to get alert message in sales invoice. In this tutorial we use one script and we test it on **gne12.gndec.ac.in**.

# Daily-Work (28-11-22)

- This morning all SDC members had a meeting  (google meet) with Satinder Sir regarding work progress . So in the meeting we discussed our problem  and    work status with sir.In our task (School project), sir told us to make workflow for applicant and registration forms instead of making different doctype
for each stage. Set permissions under it until the applicant did not deposit 500/- could not be able to open the registration form. Similarly if    registration has been completed only then he/she is able to see the enrollments.
So, now we(Jasjit, Komalpreet) are working on it .

# Daily-Work (29-11-22)

- Today we had a discussion with @ Satinderpal Sir and sir told us that we have to do all the steps (applicant and registration fee )  in one
doctype.For this we have to make three connections (Applicant fee , Advance Fee or Registration fee , Admission fee) in one doctype so it will be easy for us to do all the steps accordingly.
- I made one doctype named Student Form in gne12 and added the three connections of fees which are shown after saving the form. These fees are Applicant Fee , Advanced Fee and Fee.
# Daily-Work (30-11-22)

- Today my task is to add an Action button of Approved , Reject and
Enroll button on student applicant doctype so that after submitting
the fees and applicant form we enroll the applicant in a program or
course.

# Daily-Work (1-12-22)

- Â Last we discuss the Student Applicant process with @ Satinderpal Sir and sir said us to make the connection of fees on one doctype so accordingly to sir we create one doctype named Waheguru on gne2.gndec.ac.in under Education Domain . In this doctype we (me, Komalpreet) make the connection of Applicant fee, Advanced Fee.After saving the form these connections are visible  and then we submit the form.
Then the task was to add an action button on this, this action button was about Approved or reject the form and after applying the condition of approved or reject we update the form the enroll option to enroll the applicant in the Program.

- Now the problem we faced was that when we enroll the applicant by clicking on Enroll button on Waheguru doctype it shows that:
"Student Applicant NSPS-SESSION-2023-2024-00003 not found" So, we are going to resolve the conflict.
- I think that it is because there is no relation between Waheguru and Program Enrollment doctypes , so now I am going to see it and report here regularly if it work.

 # Daily-Work (2-12-22)
 
 - Today we crete the user for NSPS school. These user are the Teachers ,so give them Instructor role at last. The main motive was  to show the courses to the instructor. For this we have to create the program ,courses.
